I worked side by side with some amazing engineers that transmitted to me their Angular enthusiasm. I personally enjoy this framework very much and hope that I will have the chance to use it more in the future. The main thing that I appreciate about Angular is the modularity of each small component which makes it highly scalable for web applications.",

I got to use mainly FE technologies such as Jasmine, Selenium, Cucumber, but also JUnit for some tests in the backend. At my current position we use Jest and Enzyme for unit testing with React.  I believe testing is key to creating a proper user experience, to deliver quality products, and to scale as needed. I think any application should have some automation in place whether or not the application will grow.",
